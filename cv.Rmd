aboutme: "I am a researcher at SciencesPo Paris and a Senior Policy Evaluation Researcher for the National Centre for Social Research (UK). I use Natural Language Processing to map and predict political configurations using political documents and social media data of illiberal governments in Europe (at SciencesPo) and I use quasi-experiments or experiments to measure the effect of policies (at NatCen). My research focuses on using machine learning, experiments, and quasi-experiments to assess causality and predict outcomes in social and political settings. I am passionate about everything that is at the intersection of data science and social sciences."
