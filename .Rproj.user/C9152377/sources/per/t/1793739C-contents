# About me
 
 \begin{cvparagraph}
I am a postdoctoral researcher at SciencesPo Paris, where I use Natural Language Processing to conceptualise and operationalise illiberalism using text data. In my work I use BERT models to map and predict political configurations using political documents and social media data of illiberal governments in Europe. In my previous job, I focused on using quasi-experiments and experiments to measure the effect of policies on certain segments of the population. Overall my research experience focuses on using machine learning, experiments, and quasi-experiments to inform decision making in social and political settings. I am passionate about everything that is at the intersection of data science and social sciences.
